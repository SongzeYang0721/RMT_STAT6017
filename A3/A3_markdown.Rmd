```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Question 1

How is the Fisher LSD related to the two vector samples $X$ and $Y$? What is the relationship between the two parameters $(s,t)$ of $F_{s,t}$ and the three values $(p,n_1,n_2)$ describing the dimensionality and sizes of $X$ and $Y$ ?

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
