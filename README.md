# STAT6017
This is a research-led course that is based on the recent topic of using random matrix theory to handle high-dimensional data. The course is roughly based on the survey paper '2014-PaulAue' that I will supplement with more recent research literature and practical R tutorials that I have developed to illustrate the theory.
